## Description
  This is a React frontend application showcasing my work, both photography and web development.  Both the design of the site and the photography itself show attention to detail and clean visual composition.

- The image modal was created using React and JavaScript

- Much of the other components are instances of MUI components at the base level.

    - Additional stylings added using the 'sx' prop that MUI uses for styling their components.

    - Elements created with traditional HTML are styled using SCSS modules.

- Typography and Palette adjustements made to the default theme of MUI
